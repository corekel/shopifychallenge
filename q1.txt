On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells
only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value
(AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate
an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a
relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.

    a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation.
       Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
            This calculation naively calculated the average order volume by
            taking the sum of the order_amount column and dividing it by
            the number of orders. The main caveat here is that each order
            can have more than one item, and that inflates the order_amount
            value. This skews out data with outliers so that our average is far
            from the true average

            A better way to evaluate this data is to calculate the average
            price of shoes sold per order, and take the average of all those
            values. As each shop sells one type of shoe, this average price can
            tell us whether customers are shopping at stores with expensive
            shoes or cheap shoes.

    b. What metric would you report for this dataset?
        Instead of report the average over value, we can report the average
        price per pair sold. This gives us an accurate look into which price
        point consumers are more attracted to.

    c. What is its value?
        The value of the average price per pair sold for this 30 day window is
        387.7428.
